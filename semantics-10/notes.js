//!            Notes:

//* We build a Web page layout template using semantics.
//* HTML Semantic Elements Naming Convention:
// ( HTML semantics are the use of HTML elements to convey the meaning and
//structure of the content, rather than just the presentation.Semantic HTML
//helps browsers, search engines, screen readers, and other web services
//understand the content better.It also makes the code more readable and
//maintainable for developers.)

//* Header, Nav, Main(aside, section, article), Footer.
