//* We build a Web page layout template using semantics.
//* HTML Semantic Elements Naming Convention:
// (
//   HTML semantics are the use of HTML elements to convey the meaning and
// structure of the content, rather than just the presentation.Semantic HTML
// helps browsers, search engines, screen readers, and other web services
// understand the content better.It also makes the code more readable and
// maintainable for developers.
// )

//* Header, Nav, Main(aside, section, article), Footer.
//* Responsive down to Width: 375px
