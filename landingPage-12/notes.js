Ã¥//!        Notes

//* We build a simple responsive website entry page using only html and css.
//* It could also be a landing page or modified for something similar.

//* Using divs I make a design for the background then put an overlay
//* blackout with title name and enter button. Simple yet works perfectly and
//* serves it's purpose responsively.
