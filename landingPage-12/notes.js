//!        Notes

//* We build a simple website entry page using only html and css. Could also
//* be a landing page or modified for something similar.

//* Using divs I make a design for the background then put an overlay
//* blackout with title name and enter button. Simple yet works perfectly and
//* serves it's purpose.
